/*CSS follows a strict format:
selector{
property: value;
poperty: value;
}
The selector tells the browser which element is going to receive the styles rules, that are expressed as a list: 'property:value'. Each property needs to be separated with a semi-colon.
It is possible to select more then one element, just separate them with an comma:
selector 1,
selector 2{
property: value;
}
To select elements with a class use a full stop after the name of the element and write the class name, or just use a full stop and the
class name to apply the style rules to all the elements in that class:
selector.class{
property: value;
}
or
.class{
property: value;
}*/
