/*CSS follows a strict format:
selector{
property: value;
poperty: value;
}
The selector tells the browser which element is going to receive the styles rules, that are expressed as a list: 'property:value'. Each property needs to be separated with a semi-colon.
It is possible to select more then one element, just separate them with an comma:
selector 1,
selector 2{
property: value;
}
To select elements with a class use a full stop after the name of the element and write the class name, or just use a full stop and the
class name to apply the style rules to all the elements in that class:
selector.class{
property: value;
}
or
.class{
property: value;
}*/
*{ /*The * selector selects all elements.The box-sizing property defines how the width and height of an element are calculated, in this case it will calculate including the content, padding and border*/
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body{
  font-family: 'Microsoft Himalaya'; /*this CSS rule was used to add the font to all the body's page*/
  background-color: #078544; /*This rule in CSS is used to change the background colour*/
